### Overview:
The Escape to the Squeakeasy is a top-down 2D puzzle-solving game where you play as a lively hamster who's just had his first taste of beer. Now, he's determined to break out of his cage and explore the world for more! The hamster rolls through various levels using WASD controls, but there's a catch: he can't stop moving until he hits an obstacle. 

As players progress, they'll need to collect special "keys" to unlock new areas and levels packed with hazards and moving obstacles, requiring careful timing and strategy. Players also encounter buttons that they can activate by rolling into them, opening new paths that hopefully lead them to their boozy treasure.

## Core Functionality

### Roll (Movement):
- The hamster will move via **WASD** controls.
- The hamster will not stop moving until it hits an obstacle.

### Keys (Items):
- Players will collect items to unlock other parts of the game.
- These items vary depending on the environment the player is in.

### Buttons:
- Players interact with buttons by running into them, similar to boundaries.
- Different types of buttons based on the environment will trigger various events.

### Boundaries (Obstacles/Respawning):
- **Walls** will be present in many levels, blocking the player within the play space. In levels without these, there will be a game-over system.
  - **Static boundaries**: These stay in place, allowing the hamster to stop when it hits them.
  - **Moving boundaries**: These will appear in later levels, moving back and forth, requiring the player to time their movements.

### Hazards:
- Running into hazards will cause the game to “end,” forcing the player to restart from a designated point.
- Some hazards will push the hamster in a different direction than the one they were originally heading.
